## Introduction

Similar to any field in science, data analysis follows a rigorous step-by-step process. In this project I will focus mostly on how it is important to prepare and clean data so we can have a accurate results. As someone passionate about data and a dedicated football enthusiast, it’s hard for me to imagine a more fitting dataset than one related to football. The dataset I am using can be found here.

“Data is like garbage. You’d better know what you are going to do with it before you collect it.”
~ Mark Twain
Along with data cleaning and preparation, I will perform some data exploration, you never know I might find a player that can help my beloved team Arsenal improve. Lets get on with it.

## Problem Statement

Guidelines Questions:
- Do the columns have the appropriate data types?
- Can you clean and transform the value, wage, and release clause columns into columns of integers?
- Can you rename some of the column names to provide clarity and readability
- How can you handle Nulls and NA?
- Finally perform some data exploration.
